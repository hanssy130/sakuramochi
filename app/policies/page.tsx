              approach the information booth near the entrance of the event
              space and make their inquiry there.
            </p>
            <p>
              For any further issues, support staff and responsible persons will
              be defined in three groups: UBC Anime Club Executives, Event Team
              leads, and the Security Team members themselves. During the Event,
              Security Team members will be easily identifiable by wearing a
              high visibilty identifier. The Security Team is completely aware
              of all event policies including how to handle any issues, so
              please do not hesitate to bring awareness to any issues you have
              to any of the identified responsible persons. On the other hand,
              while UBC Anime Club Executives will also be wearing identifiable
              markers, please do not approach them first and prioritize
              approaching the security team unless for an emergency or dangerous
              situation.

            <p>
              For the duration of Pop-Up Hanami, all staff and security members
              will be enforcing a two strike policy in regards to the violation
              of rules, regulations, as well as any other policies of the Event.
              This will take the form of a single light warning for any
              violations, then a single stern warning by UBC Anime Club
              Executive Staff or the Security Team Lead. Any further violations
              will result in a removal from the event premises with their event
              entry badge confiscated, with any attempts to resist removal and a
              failure to cooperate resulting in a ban from future UBC Anime Club
              events. Certain rule violations will have a zero-tolerance policy,
              which will be elaborated on in their specific sections. If
              necessary, UBC Anime Club Executive Staff and Security will not
              hesitate to contact the proper authorities.

              Any rules or policies not elaborated in this section will be

              free from harm, anxiety, or discomfort while attending Pop-Up

              Team will face zero tolerance.

              This includes threats which are defined as any form of verbal or
              physical harassment or abuse, including but not limited to
              intimidation, stalking, menacing gestures, actions that cause
              injury, and any aggressive or destructive behavior intended to
              instill fear or domination. Pop-Up Hanami will not tolerate any
              threats, threatening language, or other forms of aggression. Any
              acts of violence or sexual harassment towards or by attendees,
              vendors, or staff will not be tolerated and will be reported to
              onsite security for investigation. If an act of violence or sexual
              harassment is found to have occurred, UBC Anime Executives, Pop-Up
              Hanami Team Leads, or the Security Team will take appropriate
              action against the offender, which may include immediate discharge
              from the campus.

              Event staff are <span className="font-semibold">not</span> trained

              There will strictly be no consumption of alcohol, substances,

              Smoking is not allowed within event premises. Repeated violations

              Pets are not permitted in any UBC owned or leased building or

              approved emotional support animals (ESAs) are an exemption to this

              for ensuring that the presence of the animal does not
              inappropriately disrupt the normal business operations of the
              campus nor create undue safety concerns for the animal, the

            <p>
              Despite the massive progress made in order to combat the spread of
              COVID and the loosening of restrictions of mask policies, Pop-Up
              Hanami strongly encourages those who are ill or feeling unwell to

              to wear masks if they are comfortable doing so.

              In the event of emergency situations including sudden injury or
              wounds, Pop-Up Hanami will have an emergency kit available at the
              registration desk. For any serious emergency situations which
              Pop-Up Hanami Staff and Volunteers are not prepared or trained
              for, they will be prepared to call emergency services and the

              Appearance, Costumes, Cosplay, and Prop Policies
            </p>
            <p>
              Pop-Up Hanami is an event that is open to the public of all ages.
              Those who do not obey the following will be asked to change, leave
              the Event area and/or subject to the two-strike policy. For safety
              concerns, all attendees are required to wear footwear (no socks or
              bare feet) within Pop-Up Hanami event grounds. Pop-Up Hanami
              admission badges must be visible on costumes at all times. If an
              attendee’s badge is not shown, they must be prepared to show their
              badge to a Pop-Up Hanami Staff or Volunteer upon request.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly to the policy regarding appropriate behavior, attendees
              must behave appropriately towards cosplayers. Cosplay is not
              consent. Inappropriate behavior towards cosplayers may fall under
              zero-tolerance behavior and as such the violator may be asked to
              leave.
            </p>
            <p className="text-2xl font-semibold">Appropriate Cosplay</p>
            <p>
              It is the expectation of all attendees, boothers, as well as
              Pop-Up Hanami staff and volunteers to use discretion on discerning
              appropriate cosplay. Pop-Up Hanami reserves the right to ask
              attendees to change/leave if their cosplay is deemed inappropriate
              or offensive.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inappropriate and offensive cosplay may include but is not limited
              to anything that counts as nudity, displays excessive skin, or is
              suggestive in nature, as well as anything containing hateful
              symbols or symbolism. Whether something is inappropriate and
              offensive is ultimately the discretion of the security team and
              event staff. Additionally, cosplay must not be of harm to the
              public; this can/may include: sharp and pointy objects, hazardous
              and harmful materials, large obstructing objects, etc.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, while not officially a rule or regulation regarding the
              event or cosplay, cosplaying anime or anime-related and adjacent
              cosplays are heavily encouraged, rather than cosplaying anything
              fictional.
            </p>
            <p className="text-2xl font-semibold">Weapons</p>
            <p>
              Pop-Up Hanami understands that for some cosplays, the inclusion of
              weaponry as props is part of making the cosplay feel complete.
              While prop weapons will be permissible for attendees to bring, it
              is required that cosplayers have some symbol or some recognizable
              modification so it is very obvious that it is a prop. For guns,
              this should include an orange muzzle cap or bright orange tape,
              and for other weaponry, this can take the form of a very bright
              ribbon (preferably orange).{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              All Weapons (of ANY kind, including any props and items deemed as
              a weapon) MUST, and will, be peace bonded upon receiving
              one&apos;s entry badge at our Registration table, before entering
              the main event space. The Peace Bonding must remain on your
              weapon, prop or item while in the convention and on convention
              grounds. If the Peace Bonding comes off, falls off, or detaches in
              any way, please find a Staff Member or go to the Info Table and
              inform them. You will receive a new peace bond.
            </p>
            <p className="text-2xl font-semibold">Photography</p>
            <p>
              It is the expectation that while photography is permissible during
              Pop-Up Hanami, attendees are considerate while taking photographs
              and ensure they do not take up space or disrupt proceedings, as
              well as not being disruptive through the excessive use of flash.
              Additionally, Pop-Up Hanami recommends asking the photography
              subjects to temporarily exit the venue and use the outside space
              inside or outside the Nest to take photographs.
            </p>
            <p className="font-semibold">
              All photography must have the full consent of the Participant(s),
              and it is the onus of the attendee who wishes to take photographs
              to gain that consent. Photography without consent will count as a
              violation of appropriate behavior and will follow the two-strike
              policy.
